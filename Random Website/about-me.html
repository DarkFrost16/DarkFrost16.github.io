<h1>All About Me</h1>
<h2>Summary of My Life</h2>
<p>My name is Selene Unicorn! I have a pet narwhal. His name is Mr. Narwhal. I have a friend called Bob. Bob has a cool wesite about herself. It is all about her. She also has a narwhal and unicorn website. Go check it out! I am born in the Unicorn Lands!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am 3 years old in unicorn years. Even though I was born in the unicorn lands, I am not a unicorn. Instead, I am a faerie. In fact, I am one of the High Lord's daughter. I was hidden in the Unicorn Lands with my mother just before I was born. I was raised alongside Midnight Star, an unicorn. Since I was less than 1 year old, I have been obsessed with unicorns (1 unicorn year is equal to 3 human years). I have an unicorn website. Please check it out. It is very cool. Now, I am somewhere in the human world doing studies. Maybe you know me :).</p>
